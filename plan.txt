Steps to implement:

- Study and understand 2 audio files for 3-4 different number
- extract features (mfccs), compare n_mels
- organize the audio dataset - read audio, feature extraction, augmentation, 
final audio input data for the model
- build model architecture for multiclass classification - start with a few layers of cnns for mfccs
- train with initial parameters and adjust mfcc parameters as well training parameters to improve the learning
- test and validate the model
- set up live audio input for inference
- test for live audio
