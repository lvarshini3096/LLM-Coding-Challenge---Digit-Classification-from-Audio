# LLM-Coding-Challenge---Digit-Classification-from-Audio
This project is an end-to-end audio classification system built to recognize spoken digits (0-9). It uses PyTorch to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from the [Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset).
